## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (LTS recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shristy-shahi/algo-canvas-dance.git
cd algo-canvas-dance

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev

'''bash

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Open the app** in your browser.
2. **Generate** a random array with the **"Generate Array"** button.
3. **Choose an algorithm** from the dropdown menu (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc.).
4. **Adjust speed** with the slider to watch the algorithm step-by-step or at high speed.
5. **Click Play/Pause** to start or stop the visualization anytime.
6. **Reset** to try another algorithm or array size.

💡 *Pro Tip:* Lower the speed for a more “teaching mode” effect, or increase the array size to challenge the animation performance.
